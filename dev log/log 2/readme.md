Overlap is just not working for me.. literally, I can't seem to get the text to work, and I have already spent so much time trying to get it to work.  I would use Tiled, but it would be new as well, and I shouldn't get into any more trouble.  I am Thinking of using iForce2D's box2D editor, as a basic world builder alongside with Ashley.  Hopefully I will get a basic system working from then.

Rube is working so well for me, I didn't realize how much of a world editor it is.  The hardest thing about implementing it, is the fact that it was originally designed for C, however there are language agnostic export methods, but that exports a json file.  This is good for libGDX, as it already has a built in json enterperator, but I needed a library to load the save file into the game.  Luckily it didn't take me very long to find one, I am using [tescott's RubeLoader](https://github.com/tescott/RubeLoader).

So I have built a test program for rube, and it [works](https://goo.gl/photos/MZ9e1C5kf2eM4sWt9) very well.  Hopefully I can create a game in now 3 weeks.
